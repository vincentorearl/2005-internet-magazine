        <p>Dirty Bird is especially unique because of his captivating personality. His huge twitter following [@gum_mp3] is almost as impressive as his sound. Many of his fans, including myself, were following for his hilarious tweets far before they knew he was an artist. Speaking of his media presence... check out his dope website <a href="gum.computer" target="_blank">gum.computer</a>!</p>

        <h3>Meet Voldy Moyo</h3>
        <div class="rectangleVoldy">
          <p>Voldy Moyo (aka v7backin2007) is a multitalented rapper, singer, and writer based out of Wakefield, UK. His underground sound mixed with dark trap and low-fi influences make for a unique style that is hard to skip. His conceptual project, <a style="color:red;" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4sTdACy8xUXGdZqELkWhA0?si=tMrSIePMT7is5FzzPMErWg" target="_blank"><em>Tale of Red Star</em></a>, is one of the strangest, yet captivating pieces of art I've ever listened to... the songs do not offer much in structure or production, yet I can not seem to get them out of my head. Moyo's avant-garde aesthetic is one that has the listener constantly wanting more... so listen!</p>

        <h3>¡AXOLOTES MEXICANOS!</h3>

            <p>Axolotes Mexicanos, somewhat ironically, are a Spanish pop group based out of Madrid that I have been obsessed with latley. The group offers unique fusion of Spanish and Japanese influences, presenting glittering rock ballads reminiscent of the J-Rock that defines anime soundtracks, while still keeping an indie and almost bedroom aesthetic to their sound and presentation. Axolotes Mexicanos may present themselves as a cute little rock band, but their often-times expliticit content and twisted subject matter makes for a beautifully dark contrast.</p>

            </div>
           <p>The Axolotes Mexicanos' catalog dates back to their 2015 EP, <em>Holi <3</em> in 2015. My favorite of their releases, however, is their most recent, 2021 album, <em>3 (:3)</em>. Some of my favorite songs of thiers have to be "Gotelé" off <em>:3</em> and "Double Check" off <em>Salu2</em>. It is always amazing to feel drawn and connected to music that is sung in a language you are not fluent in; to me it is just a testament to the fact that music is truely a universal language.</p>
